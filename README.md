Windows NTLM/Kerberos Authentication Backdoor 

Fork with example Visual Studio Project. Includes additional files from [Microsoft Detours](https://github.com/microsoft/Detours) to allow for compilation.

Bonus Privileged Injector taken from RIT's [original repository](https://github.com/RITRedteam/nosferatu/blob/master/privileged-injector/Source.cpp).

## How it Works

First, the DLL is injected into the `lsass.exe` process, and will begin hooking authentication WinAPI calls. The targeted functions are:

- `NTLM: NtlmShared!MsvpPasswordValidate()`
- `Kerberos: cryptdll!CDLocateCSystem()`
- `Kerberos: samsrv!SamIRetrieveMultiplePrimaryCredentials()`

In the pursuit of not being detected, the hooked functions will call the original first and allow for the normal flow of authentication. Only after seeing that authentication has failed will the hook swap out the actual NTLM hash with the backdoor hash.

## Usage

nosferatu must be compiled as a 64 bit DLL.

## Limitations
Hooks are not applied for 60 seconds while the system boots.
